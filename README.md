# GraphQL React Event Booking

Based on a tutorial from Academind [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) channel about GraphQL, React, and charts.

Their source code can be found at [github](https://github.com/academind/yt-graphql-react-event-booking-api)

My code is restructure to something closer to my ideal and has some additional improvements and fixes as well.

Beyond the things that they have done I have added `prettier` and `eslint` as well with coding styles that fit my coding style

This project also contains the "Technical introduction to GraphQL" presentation that goes with this project.

## Presentation

The presentation can be found in the `graphql-preso` folder. To view the presentation open the `graphql.html` file in your favorite browser.

If you want to make changes to the presentation or find out more about it you can find the instructions at [graphql-preso/README.md](graphql-preso/README.md)
