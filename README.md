# GraphQL React Event Booking

Based on a tutorial from Academind [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) channel about GraphQL, React, and charts.

Their source code can be found at [github](https://github.com/academind/yt-graphql-react-event-booking-api)

My code is restructure to something closer to my ideal and has some additionatl improvements and fixes in as well.

Beyond the thigns that they have done I have added `prettier` and `eslint` as well with coding styles that fit my coding style
